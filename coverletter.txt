To ADITION,

I am fullstack developer with experience in Clojure, Nodejs and Rails, tech stacks, but my recent interest and work has been in frontend development. Mostly react and clojurescript and js, which is why i am applying to this position for the job of a frontend developer with react. I am not really a designer though but know my way around photoshop just because i used to downscale images to lower resolution to be used in our web apps.

Also you should consider my application if you are willing to sponsor my work visa.

Kind Regards
Pankaj
